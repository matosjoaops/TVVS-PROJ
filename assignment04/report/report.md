## Use cases
- Create a task without a context or a project
- Mark a task as done
- Search for task text

The first two use cases were chosen because they represent the main functionality of the application, which is to create a list of tasks that can be marked as done. The last one was chosen because it's useful for a user to be able to find previously written tasks. By testing these use cases, we make sure that they are working properly.

## Create a task without a context or a project

### State Machine

The idle state is the application initial dashboard, where it's possible to see the projects, categories and list of tasks, as well as create new ones. It's possible to create a new task by clicking on the new task text field, where it's possible to choose its title. It's also possible to choose a priority, by clicking on the priority field. When clicking the "+" button or hitting the "Enter" key, the task is created and it's possible to see it on the application dashboard. In this state machine there are 3 states, 8 transitions and 4 events.

### Transition Tree

The transition tree describes all the possible paths of this use case. There are 4 different paths.

### Transition Table

| States\\Events     | Click on text field | Click on priority field  | Click on "+" | Hit the "Enter" key | 
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- | 
| Idle               |     Task Text Edit  | Task Priority Edit       |              |                     | 
| Task Text Edit     |                     | Task Priority Edit       | Idle         | Idle                | 
| Task Priority Edit |                     |                          | Idle         | Idle                | 

The transition table of this use case allows us to identify the sneak paths, i.e., identify paths with unspecified behavior.
