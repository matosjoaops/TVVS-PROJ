## Brief description of the JUnit features explored by the tests

A variety of JUnit features were used in the developed unit tests, such as:

- **Parameterized tests**: used to test the different partitions without having to write duplicate code
- **Assert expected exceptions**: to make sure an exception is thrown when it should be
- **Types of assertions used**:
  - **assertEquals**: to assert that two values are equal
  - **assertNotEquals**: to assert that two values are different
  - **assertTrue**: to assert that an expression evaluates to true
  - **assertFalse**: to assert that an expression evaluates to false
  - **assertNull**: to assert that a value is null
